Ruby Newby is trying some new this month! Instead of your regularly scheduled blog post covering the _Beginner's Track_ topic, I've provided a screencast of my presentation as well as the slides for reference.

Questions? Comments? You can find me [@lyonsinbeta](//twitter.com/lyonsinbeta) on twitter.

Enjoy!
