Hooray for APIs - Github - Madlibs - and Ruby!

In the attached screencast I go over a 20 minute tutorial on
pulling down commit messages from the Github API and using them to
create madlibs (for fun and also profit).

You can find me: [@ccanduc](//twitter.com/ccanduc) on twitter,
[rrgayhart](http://github.com/rrgayhart) on github and cranking out
code at [Quick Left](http://quickleft.com/).

Cheers!
